Singly Linked List ImplementationÂ¶

In a Linked List the first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. 
Let's discuss the pros and cons of Linked Lists:

Pros ##!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!##
Linked Lists have constant-time insertions and deletions in any position, in comparison, 
arrays require O(n) time to do the same thing.

Linked lists can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time 
(remember our lectures on Array sizing form the Array Sequence section of the course!)

Cons
To access an element in a linked list, you need to take O(k) time to go from the head of the list to the kth element. 
In contrast, arrays have constant time operations to access elements in an array.
