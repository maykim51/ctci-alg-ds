Leetcode 1 twosum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

SOLUTION
1) bruteforce O(N^2)
2) hash map

                return [buff_dict[nums[i]], i]
            else:
                buff_dict[target - nums[i]] = i
